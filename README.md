# SQL Detective Challenge 🔍

This is a fun SQL case-solving project I did to brush up on my SQL skills and simulate a real-world investigation scenario.

## 🗂️ About the Challenge

The case takes place in a fictional city called **SQL City**.  
A murder has occurred, and the task is to identify the suspect(s) by querying various tables like:

- **crime_scene_report**
- **person**
- **drivers_license**
- **get_fit_now_member**
- **get_fit_now_check_in**
- **interview**

## 🧩 My Approach

I treated this challenge like a real investigation:

1. **Read the crime report** to get the details.
2. Analyzed and extracted clues from interview transcripts.
3. **Cross-reference gym memberships, check-ins, license plates, and addresses.**
4. Narrow down the suspects step by step using SQL queries.
